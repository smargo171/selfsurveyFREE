    Does your blood pressure really drop when you drink less coffee? Does your sleep really improve if you do fitness exercises? If you ever wanted to <b>track such dependencies</b> in your health, mood and well being or discover those dependencies in the word around you, <b>selfsurvey</b> is a perfect tool for this.
<p>
    <b>Create your own survey</b> on the go or <b>import</b> it from a text file, run it daily or several times a day, discover dependencies by <b>looking at the charts</b> or export data for the analysis in your <b>favorite spreadsheet</b> application. All actions are <b>off-line</b>; you need Internet connection only to <b>share the questions or results by email</b>, if you want to.
<p>
    There are <b>some rules</b> to take care about. Create a survey set, and then create questions and the answers. The <b>answers have to be ranked</b> in a way that the "best" and "greenest" answer is on top (you can move it up and down after you've created it, no worries). The more answers you define, the better. If there is only one answer, the app can't tell if it's "good" or "bad".
<p>
    The app comes with some <b>demo</b> survey pre-installed. Feel free to use it, but don't expect any medical / scientific correctness or meaning of the questions or answers.  Better <b>try your own!</b>
<p>
    If you need support or have a question, please write to <b>selfsurvey@m-servic.es</b> and we will help you!
